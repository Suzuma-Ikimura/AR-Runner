## About

This project was designed as a demonstration of programming skills in Augmented Reality, working with physics and reading objects with Vuforia - Image Target.
Unfortunately, I can not provide the whole folder of the project, because it uses the license keys which I always use, and if you remove them from the folder the project will not run.
Therefore, below I will provide photos and video evidence of the working project, as well as leave the scripts that were used for what would write the project.

## DESCRIPTION AND PHOTO

Here I will present some screenshots from the game, in the future I will pour video, so you can see the Gameplay!
